## Development

### Architecture

The extension uses Chrome's Manifest V3 architecture with:
- **Service Worker** (`background.js`): Handles file downloads and extension lifecycle
- **Content Script** (`content.js`): Extracts data from GitHub PR pages
- **Popup** (`popup/`): User interface for controlling the extension

### Key Technologies

- **Manifest V3**: Latest Chrome extension standard
- **DOM Parsing**: Extracts data directly from GitHub's HTML structure
- **Chrome APIs**: Uses `chrome.downloads`, `chrome.storage`, and `chrome.tabs`
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features with async/await

### Permissions

The extension requires these permissions:
- `activeTab`: Access to the current GitHub page
- `storage`: Save user preferences
- `downloads`: Download JSON reports
- `host_permissions`: Access to github.com and api.github.com

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
- Ensure you're on a GitHub pull request page
- Check that the page has fully loaded
- Refresh the page and try again

### Data Extraction Issues
- Some PR elements might not be visible (collapsed sections)
- Ensure all comments and reviews are expanded
- Large PRs might take longer to process

### Download Problems
- Check Chrome's download settings
- Ensure you have write permissions to the download folder
- Try a different filename if there are conflicts
